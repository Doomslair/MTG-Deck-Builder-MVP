## About The Project
This project is a deckbuilding application to allow users to manage MTG decks and have meaningful tests that give actionable information. This is a refinement of my MTG-MVP project where I built this in two days, but of course, the code was rough, so I am rewriting it in a cleaner, and more stylistically pleasing way.


## Usage
After installing all necessary packages, run npm run dev in order to start a local server. No additional setup should be needed.
